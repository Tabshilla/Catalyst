#a web framework that we use to create web applications
#django is procedural (step by step)
#it follows MVC Model/policy/arrangement
#M-Model, V-View(function),C-Controller
#we use methods to capture data
#we shall have views files in django and they handle requests
#a model is anything related to a database
#a file called models.py and it will be responsible for anything related to databases.(models.py, 'file-name' database table,one or more tables)
#controllers are URLS. they are connected to the requests(will create a file for the URLS, this sends it to any matching view that matches it)
#views.py will BE CREATED FOR  all urls to passby
