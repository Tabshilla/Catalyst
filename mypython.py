#how the computer works
#it is the art of writing computer instructions and a science of how principles/ things we follow
#art also contains different styles of computer programming
#memory of the computer is where we store our different styles
#similarities btn computers and the human body
#memory
#languages
#input and output
#body
#brain and CPU
#the CPU and memory work hand in hand. they synchronize
#the memory of the computer includes;
#the optical memory is written or read from its optical memory e.g DVD OR CD
#HDD/Metallic drive/ Hard disk drive. it is read from or written using electronic system
#flashdrive. using copying methods
#it is also divided into primary, secondary, internal, external
#external ie flash, DVD or CD
#Internal ie RAM,HDD.  These are found within  the computer
#Harddisk.
#this is the core memory of the computer.
#its stores all the programs in the hard disk 
#the memory is inside the hard disk.
#the CPU  doesnt directly communicate with the hard disk so when you open it, you load the information to the RAM  then the CPU uses that information.
#after you close that program, the RAM clears it and therefore it only stores information temporarily,
#that is why it is called a random access memory.
#frequqntly opened programs are sent to the cache memory of the computer.
#baffer memory is where data is stored before it is sent to the ram then to the cpu for example 
#when you play music, it is loaded to the VLC  first and then it is stored in the buffer memorythen it is sent to the
#to the CPU  that plays the music
#Formatting/ Partitioning of the memory.
#the memory of the computer is unasable because it is fixed especially for new computers.
#therefore for it to work, we partition it or format the memory. we label the partitions and those partitions have
#unique IDS are the identifiers of the partitions
#RAM then loads the unique identifiers and that is what the RAM temporarily stores.
#the unique IDs are the addresses of the memory.
#when you load many thing to the RAM then the computer will become slow ie opening many files ago

#PYTHON: This is a programming language designed by Guido Van Rossum
#python is a fourth generation language
#python was named after a british comedy called montepy
#python is used in the following applications; instagram, dropbox, google search, firefox, and youtube
#we transform human languages into binary languages through interpretation, and compilation.
#python is an interpretated language.
#intepreted languages are mutable while compiled languages are immutable

#SYNTAX
#these are rules that govern the use of programming languages 
#it is a constitution of languages 
#syntax is divided into versions and distribution(packaging)
#version 2 ias the first version of python. it is also the most widely used version.
#python 2 was transformed into python 3
#when python is opened in interpreative mode, when you close you will lose your work. the next time you open it, you willnot get that work
#when you open it on script, you will always get that work
#opening python vs code is in script mode
#any component or value put in quotes will be output in quotes
#a statement is a complete instruction to a computer
#two or more statements make up a code.
#So CODING is the writing of two or more statements
#variables are names programmers give to spaces in the memory of the computer

#VARIABLES
#hash symbol represents a comment
#variables that are numerical variables are written as num1, num2 and not 1num. 
#variable names should not have spaces but composite variables can be separated by an uderscore. e.g my_name
#or you can use a camel case eg; myAge
#variable names shouldnt start with capital letters
#numbers are not put in quotes but words are suposed to be quoted, e.g "tabshilla", num1 = 2
#use short notation eg cust for "customer", cntry for "country"
#variable names shoulnt be different when repeated because python is case sensitive e.g "name" and "Name" are two diffferent things

#DECLARING VARIABLES
#process of naming computer memory
#initialization is the process of giving variables values eg "Age" = 26
#so "Age" is the variable, 26 is the value
#values that are not numbers are supposed to be put in quotes
# = is the assignment operators

#Datatypes in python
#space needed for conteent to be intered into a computer
#e.g. numeric, float, string, integer, complex numbers
#whole numbers are integers e.g. 1, 2, 3
#decimal numbers are floats e.g. 1.5, 0.5
#strings are what is put in quotes or double quotes
#complex numbers are ones written with letters e.g 1+2j

#sequencing 
#this includes lists, tuples, and ranges

#a list is a variable that can store moreythan one value
#lists can be manipulated hence mutable
#lists can be empty and can store values later
#values are put in square brackets[]
#lists can be appended
#appending is a specialized command in python used to add values to lists
#print is a special command in python used to output values to a computer screen
#positions in lists start from 0 and end on 9. tto get positions you count number of positions minus one
#e.g 
country= [["uganda","kenya","tanzania"],["america","canada"], "brazil", "sudan"]
#so uganda is in position 0 and sudan is in position -1
#positions are given from left to right or from right to left
#any value is supposed to be indexed or numbered

#tuples
#tuples are read only
#that means that tuples can not be mutable. you can not delete it or add anything to it. for example a pdf
#tuples can be typecasted
#typecasting is the conversion of a value from one data typr to another
#lists can be typescasted thus you can change a a list into a tuple but you cant convert a tuple to a list

#mapping
#we use curly brackets {}
#here we asign differnt keys to values
#each value has its own key e.g 
person = {"name":tabshilla", "age":20, email:adongtm@gmail.com, "username": "adongtm}

#sets
#unordered list of unique values
#when printed they are unordered and not repeated

#operators 
#we have signs like 
(*, +, -,/,//)
#we have additional operators e.g
sum = num1 + num2

#we have subtractions oprators e.g.
sub = num1 - num2

#we have multiplication operators e.g
mul = num1 * num2

#we have division operators e.g

div = num1 / num2

#we have floor division operators e.g

floordiv = num1 // num2

#we have modulo operators e.g

mod = num1 % num2

#we have exponentiation operators e.g

pow = (num1 **2)

#we have assignment operators e.g
num1 = num2 + num3
num1 = num2+=2

#assignment operators are additional, subtraction, multiplication and division.

#always open a new terminal to see the results of the print command
#e.g
print(sum)
print(sub)
print(mul)
print(div)
print(floordiv)
print(num1)
